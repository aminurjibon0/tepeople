                        <h1>5 trainings that will help you to cope with the "New Normal" world</h1>
                        <p>The world has changed as a consequence of COVID 19 pandemic. Government to corporations, everyone got the message that everything can go on by working from home! If you are thinking that humans never experienced social distancing; you are wrong. Let’s start with a story. Plague had visited Europe several times. In 1665, Plague hit England. That time Sir Isaac Newton was studying at trinity college, Cambridge. He went to a village during that pandemic time and spent more than a year to ensure social distancing. The situation was just like in 2020. But interestingly Newton made most of his early major inventions during this time. You must have heard about the story of inventing “the law of gravity”. Newton was sitting under an apple tree and suddenly an apple fell into his head and right after that got the idea of gravity! That apple tree was in that country house where he used to live during the quarantine. Newton’s very famous “prism experiment” took place during this time. Also, he invented a mathematical theory named “method of fluxion” an earlier version of today’s differential calculus.  So, Newton did all those by working from home. What are you doing during this pandemic time? Do not get frustrated if you did not invent something like Newton did! We are here with some good plans for you so that you can also become someone!</p>
                        <p><strong>Software Testing: </strong> If you are a non-tech person but searching for the best way to pursue your career in the IT sector then doing “Software Testing” training is the best option.

                        <p><strong>Help Desk Analyst/IT Support: </strong>When you have a problem with your products (Smartphone, Computer) or services (mobile SIM operators) you might call, email or get engaged to a live chat with company employees. The people who handle your problems are known as “Help Desk Analyst” or “IT supports Stuff”. In this competitive business world, every company want to provide a premium after-sales service and every organization is busy to build a top-class customer relationship management (CRM), as a result, companies recruiting help desk analyst continuously.

                        <p><strong>Proper Computer Training:</strong> How do you define “a computer expert”. Using the search engine or face booking are okay but corporations will not consider these as “skills”.

To grow in your career, you need to have an excellent idea on MS Office, Google Sheets, Managing files and folders (professionally), and some advanced subjects. A good computer course will make you smarter. Companies now need smart desk employees who are excellent in computer skills.

                        <p><strong>SEO:</strong> It has become harder for the website to earn traffic as there are too many websites. So companies need a Search Engine Optimization Expert to solve this issue. SEO is very important to help users to find the website.
